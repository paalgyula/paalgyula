## Questions to me:

**Q**: Why do you prefer GCP instead of AWS
  
**A**: I like google's ecosystem, and firebase is incredibly fast and efficient for the projects I've made, and with Google's Cloud Run the project prices reduced to ~15-20% from hosted kubernetes engine. I love this approach, and connected with firebase... It's so easy to create apps, I just have to focus on software architecture, not on over-architecture what you can easily achieve on AWS.

**Q**: Are you really a hacker?

**A**: Ahh... I hate this question... What's a **hacker** for you? 
- A person who is breaking into your facebook account? **No, I'm definitely not a hacker**
- A person who has a knowledgebase to ***identify*** vulnerabilities in various systems? **Yes, in this case I am**
